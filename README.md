Hello! I want to learn programming, so I decided to start right now!
My knowledge of English is sad, but I have a fighting spirit and am ready to learn!
I can't say that I know a computer at the level of a Master, but I quickly find the "necessary buttons" when I really need it.
I believe that I have potential and I am ready to finally fully open it to the world;)
